[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-AspectJ%20Gradle-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://android-arsenal.com/details/1/4578) ![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Archinamon/GradleAspectJ-Android.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Archinamon/GradleAspectJ-Android)

A Gradle plugin which enables AspectJ for Android builds.
Supports writing code with AspectJ-lang in `.aj` files and in java-annotation style.
Full support of Android product flavors and build types.
Support Kotlin, Groovy, Scala and any other languages that compiles into java bytecode.

Actual version: `com.archinamon:android-gradle-aspectj:2.2.2`.
Re-written with brand new <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/transform-api" target="_blank">Transform API</a>!

This plugin is completely friendly with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hvisser/android-apt" target="_blank">APT</a> (Android Annotation Processing Tools) and <a href="https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda/" target="_blank">Retrolambda</a> project (but Java 8 not supported in .aj files).
<a href="https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations" target="_blank">AndroidAnnotations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/square/dagger" target="_blank">Dagger</a> are also supported and works fine.

This plugin has many ideas from the others similar projects, but no one of them grants full pack of features like this one.
Nowdays it has been completely re-written using Transform API.

Key features
-----

Augments Java, Kotlin, Groovy bytecode simultaneously!<br />
Works with background mechanics of jvm-based languages out-of-box!<br />
[How to teach Android Studio to understand the AspectJ!](IDE)

It is easy to isolate your code with aspect classes, that will be simply injected via cross-point functions, named `advices`, into your core application. The main idea is â€” code less, do more!

AspectJ-Gradle plugin provides supply of all known JVM-based languages, such as Groovy, Kotlin, etc. That means you can easily write cool stuff which may be inject into any JVM language, not only Java itself! :)

To start from you may look at my <a href="https://github.com/Archinamon/AspectJExampleAndroid" target="_blank">example project</a>. And also you may find useful to look at <a href="https://eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/quick5.pdf" target="_blank">reference manual</a> of AspectJ language and simple <a href="https://eclipse.org/aspectj/sample-code.html" target="_blank">code snipets</a>. In case aspectj-native not supported by Android Studio, you may write a java-classes with aspectj annotations.

May not work with InstantRun due to a slicer bug. Please, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/35169716/483603" target="_blank">switch off InstanceRun</a> if you have faced any problems (e.g. class file not found in DexPath in runtime).

Two simple rules you may consider when writing aspect classes.
- Do not write aspects outside the `src/$flavor/aspectj` source set! These aj-classes will be excluded from java compiler.
- Do not try to access aspect classes from java/kotlin/etc. In case java compiler doesn't know anything about aspectj, it will lead to compile errors on javac step.

These rules affects only in case you're writing in native aj-syntax.
You may write aspects in java-annotation style and being free from these limitations.

Usage
-----

First add a maven repo link into your `repositories` block of module build file:
```groovy
mavenCentral()
maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
```
Don't forget to add `mavenCentral()` due to some dependencies inside AspectJ-gradle module.

Add the plugin to your `buildscript`'s `dependencies` section:
```groovy
classpath 'com.github.Archinamon:GradleAspectJ-Android:2.2.2'
```

Apply the `aspectj` plugin:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.archinamon.aspectj'
```

Now you can write aspects using annotation style or native (even without IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition).
Let's write simple Application advice:
```java
import android.app.Application;
import android.app.NotificationManager;
import android.content.Context;
import android.support.v4.app.NotificationCompat;

aspect AppStartNotifier {

    pointcut postInit(): within(Application) && execution(* Application.onCreate());

    after() returning: postInit() {
        Application app = (Application) thisJoinPoint.getTarget();
        NotificationManager nmng = (NotificationManager) app.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
        nmng.notify(9999, new NotificationCompat.Builder(app)
                              .setTicker("Hello AspectJ")
                              .setContentTitle("Notification from aspectJ")
                              .setContentText("privileged aspect AppAdvice")
                              .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
                              .build());
    }
}
```

Tune extension
-------

```groovy
aspectj {
    ajc '1.8.9'

    includeJar 'design', 'support-v4', 'dagger'
    includeAspectsFromJar 'my-aj-logger-lib', 'any-other-libs-with-aspects'
    ajcExtraArgs << '-referenceInfo' << '-warn:deprecation'

    weaveInfo true
    debugInfo false
    addSerialVersionUID false
    noInlineAround false
    ignoreErrors false
    
    breakOnError true
    experimental false

    logFileName 'ajc-details.log'
}
```

- `ajc` Allows to define the aspectj runtime jar version manually (1.8.9 current)

- `includeJar` Name filter to include any jar/aar which name or path satisfies the filter
- `includeAspectsFromJar` Name filter to include any jar/aar with compiled binary aspects you wanna affect your project
- `ajcExtraArgs` Additional parameters for aspectj compiler

- `weaveInfo` Enables printing info messages from Aj compiler
- `debugInfo` Adds special debug info in aspect's bytecode
- `addSerialVersionUID` Adds serialVersionUID field for Serializable-implemented aspect classes
- `noInlineAround` Strict ajc to inline around advice's body into the target methods
- `ignoreErrors` Prevent compiler from aborting if errors occurrs during processing the sources

- `breakOnError` Allows to continue project building when ajc fails or throws any errors
- `experimental` Enables experimental ajc options: `-XhasMember` and `-Xjoinpoints:synchronization,arrayconstruction`. More details in <a href="https://github.com/Archinamon/GradleAspectJ-Android/issues/18" target="_blank">issue #18</a>

- `logFileName` Defines name for the log file where all Aj compiler info writes to

Working tests
-------
Just write a test and run them! If any errors occurrs please write an issue :)

ProGuard
-------
Correct tuning will depends on your own usage of aspect classes. So if you declares inter-type injections you'll have to predict side-effects and define your annotations/interfaces which you inject into java classes/methods/etc. in proguard config.

Basic rules you'll need to declare for your project:
```
-adaptclassstrings
-keepattributes InnerClasses, EnclosingMethod, Signature, *Annotation*

-keepnames @org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect class * {
    ajc* <methods>;
}
```

If you will face problems with lambda factories, you may need to explicitely suppress them. That could happen not in aspect classes but in any arbitrary java-class if you're using Retrolambda.
So concrete rule is:
```
-keep class *$Lambda* { <methods>; }
-keepclassmembernames public class * {
    *** lambda*(...);
}
```
